one to many relationship
loose coupling between observer and observable

Concrete Observer has concrete Observable

Does observer class violates single responsiblity principle...


The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between objects.
Subjects, or as we also know them, Observables, update Observers using a common
interface.
Observers are loosely coupled in that the Observable knows nothing about them,
other than that they implement the Observer interface.
You can push or pull data from the Observable when using the pattern (pull is
considered more “correct”).
Don’t depend on a specific order of notification for your Observers.

1. Why not use global variable ?

Object will be created whether we need it or not, if it is resource intensive, and not used, it will waste resource.

why the need of double locking?
you can synchronize the method right?
-- synchronize is expensive and it affects the performance of the application.
Moreover we need synchronize only at the first time creation of the object.

so we check if this is the first time we are creating an object ,

if(uniqueInstance == NULL ) , if its the first time , then enter synchronized block.

Can we subclass singleton class-
No, we have private constructor , so we cannot.

even if we make the constructor public, then the unique instance is static, wont get benifit out of subclassing.
